Start(Attempt #1)

- We're going to focus on the SSD first, plug your SSD into your pc with your SATA to USB hub
- Navigate to disk management using the search bar on your pc and check to see if It's initialized or showing up
- If It's uninitialized, choose MBR and initialize your SSD. If It's initialized and GPT, we'll change it to MBR after we reformat
- Next, navigate to your file explorer and right click on your drive
